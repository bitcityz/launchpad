The play-to-earn game will be laced with violence and gore bidding to become the ultimate Kingpin whilst building your empire. This will be built with realistic imagery along with voice & text chat features with intent to pull players into an augmented reality space. Ultimate aim of gamers will be to conquer & control Sin City and be designated as the ultimate Kingpin, until the next conquerors emerge.",
    "play_to_earn_model": "The play-to-earn model is very much instigated as head-to-head contests. Where users will gang battle to win SIN tokens. The play-to-earn model is fully recyclable where commissions on NFT sales go back into a rewards pool, for users to earn whilst they play.",
